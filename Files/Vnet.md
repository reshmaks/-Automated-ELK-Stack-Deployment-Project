#### 1. Creating a New vNet

Make sure that you are logged into your personal Azure account, where your cloud security unit VMs are located.

- Create a new vNet located in the same resource group (Red Team Resource group).

- Make sure this vNet is located in a _new_ region and not the same region as your other VM's.
